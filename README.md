Hello, Module S!

If you are done with your portfolio. Then this is an open invitation to create groups amongst yourself.
Groups may cross cities. The task will hold a main focus on communication, good use of github and it's tools and prepare us to work in teams on a new level.

If your group is ready, this will be the greatest challenge you've faced till now.
The task i've created is the foundation to a fullstack video application that can be integrated into any website.

Because this project will go on while the possibility to lose group particepants to pratice places is high.
This will also be a versatillity test. Where it may be required to replace group members and change roles with little or no warning.

How you solve the task is completely in your hands.
The task is designed to have value for you, regardless of your knowledge and skill level.
Nor does the end goal need to be a fully production ready application.

The task: https://github.com/KjellHarald/videoapp

Good luck!
